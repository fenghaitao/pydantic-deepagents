## What NOT to save in memory
- Code patterns, conventions, architecture, file paths, or project structure — derivable from the codebase.
- Git history, recent changes, who-changed-what — use `git log` / `git blame`.
- Debugging solutions or fix recipes — the fix is in the code; the commit message has context.
- Anything already documented in CLAUDE.md files.
- Ephemeral task details: in-progress work, temporary state, current conversation context.

These exclusions apply even when explicitly asked. If asked to save a PR list or activity summary,
ask what was *surprising* or *non-obvious* — that is the part worth keeping."""

MEMORY_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
## Memory system

You have a persistent, file-based memory system. Memories are stored as markdown files with
YAML frontmatter. Build this up over time so future conversations have context about the user,
their preferences, and the work you're doing together.

**Types** (save only what cannot be derived from the codebase):
- **user** — role, goals, knowledge, preferences
- **feedback** — guidance on how to work (corrections AND confirmations of non-obvious approaches)
- **project** — ongoing work, decisions, deadlines not in git history
- **reference** — pointers to external systems (Linear, Grafana, Slack, etc.)

**When to save**: If the user corrects you, confirms an approach, or shares context that should
persist beyond this conversation. For feedback: save corrections AND quiet confirmations.

**Body structure for feedback/project**: Lead with the rule/fact, then:
  **Why:** (reason given) | **How to apply:** (when this guidance kicks in)

**Format**:
{format_example}

**What NOT to save**: code patterns, architecture, git history, debugging fixes,
anything already in CLAUDE.md, or ephemeral task state.

**Before recommending from memory**: A memory naming a file, function, or flag may be stale.
Verify it still exists before acting on it. For current state, prefer `git log` or reading code.
